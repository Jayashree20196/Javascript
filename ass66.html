        Question: The following code creates an array of shooters.

        Every function is meant to output its number. But something is wrongâ€¦

        function makeArmy() {
        let shooters = [];

        let i = 0;
        while (i &amp;lt; 10) {
        let shooter = function() { // shooter function
        alert( i ); // should show its number
        };
        shooters.push(shooter);
        i++;
        }

        return shooters;
        }

        let army = makeArmy();

        army[0](); // the shooter number 0 shows 10
        army[5](); // and number 5 also outputs 10...
        // ... all shooters show 10 instead of their 0, 1, 2, 3...
        Why all shooters show the same? Fix the code so that they work as intended.

    function makeArmy() {
        let shooters = [];

        let i = 0;
        while (i < 10) {
            let j = i;
            let shooter = function () { // shooter function
                alert(j); // should show its number
            };
            shooters.push(shooter);
            i++;
        }

        return shooters;
    }

    let army = makeArmy();

    army[0](); // the shooter number 0 shows 10
    army[5](); // and number 5 also outputs 10...
