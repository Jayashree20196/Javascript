            Question :  There is a salaries object:

            let salaries = {
            "John": 100,
            "Pete": 300,
            "Mary": 250
            };
            Create the function topSalary(salaries) that returns the name of the top-paid person.

            If salaries is empty, it should return null.
            If there are multiple top-paid persons, return any of them.
        */
