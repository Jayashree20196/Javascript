        Question: There’s an array of messages:

        let messages = [
        {text: "Hello", from: "John"},
        {text: "How goes?", from: "John"},
        {text: "See you soon", from: "Alice"}
        ];
        Your code can access it, but the messages are managed by someone else’s code. New messages are added,
        old ones are removed regularly by that code, and you don’t know the exact moments when it happens.

        Now, which data structure you could use to store information whether the message “have been read”?
        The structure must be well-suited to give the answer “was it read?” for the given message object.

        P.S. When a message is removed from messages, it should disappear from your structure as well.

        P.P.S. We shouldn’t modify message objects directly. If they are managed by someone else’s code,
        then adding extra properties to them may have bad consequences.

    let messages = [
        { text: "Hello", from: "John" },
        { text: "How goes?", from: "John" },
        { text: "See you soon", from: "Alice" }
    ];

    let readMessages = new WeakSet();

    // two messages have been read
    readMessages.add(messages[0]);
    readMessages.add(messages[1]);
    // readMessages has 2 elements

    // ...let's read the first message again!
    readMessages.add(messages[0]);
    // readMessages still has 2 unique elements

    // answer: was the message[0] read?
    alert("Read message 0: " + readMessages.has(messages[0])); // true

    messages.shift();
//
