        Question :  Write a function count(obj) that returns the number of properties in the object:

        let user = {
        name: 'John',
        age: 30
        };

        alert( count(user) ); // 2
        Try to make the code as short as possible.

        P.S. Ignore symbolic properties, count only “regular” ones.

    function count(obj) {
        var sum = 0;
        //passes through the object
        for (let item in obj) {
            //counts value
            sum++;
        }
        return sum;

        //other method
        //Object.keys(obj).length;
    }

    let user = {
        name: 'John',
        age: 30,
    };

    alert(count(user));
