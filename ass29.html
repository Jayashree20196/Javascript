        Question : Write a function getSecondsToday() that returns the number of seconds from the beginning of today.

        For instance, if now 10:00 am, and there was no daylight savings shift, then:

        getSecondsToday() == 36000 // (3600 * 10)
        The function should work in any day. That is, it should not have a hard-coded value of “today”.

    */

    function getSecondsToday() {
        //gets todays date
        var today = new Date();
        //getHours : gets hours
        //getMinutes: get the number of minutes
        //getSeconds: gets the number of seconds.
        //converts hrs and mins into seconds.
        var time = today.getHours() * 3600 + today.getMinutes() * 60 + today.getSeconds();
        return time;
    }
    alert(getSecondsToday());
