        Question: We have two hamsters: speedy and lazy inheriting from the general hamster object.

        When we feed one of them, the other one is also full. Why? How to fix it?

        let hamster = {
        stomach: [],

        eat(food) {
        this.stomach.push(food);
        }
        };

        let speedy = {
        __proto__: hamster
        };

        let lazy = {
        __proto__: hamster
        };

        // This one found the food
        speedy.eat("apple");
        alert( speedy.stomach ); // apple

        // This one also has it, why? fix please.
        alert( lazy.stomach ); // apple
    */

    let hamster = {
        stomach: [],

        eat(food) {
            //instead of pushing assign it to array.
            this.stomach = [food];
        }
    };

    let speedy = {
        __proto__: hamster
    };

    let lazy = {
        __proto__: hamster
    };

    // This one found the food
    speedy.eat("apple");
    alert(speedy.stomach); // apple
    //empty
    alert(lazy.stomach);
