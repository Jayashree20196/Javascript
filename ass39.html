        Question:  There’s an array of messages as in the previous task. The situation is similar.

        let messages = [
        {text: "Hello", from: "John"},
        {text: "How goes?", from: "John"},
        {text: "See you soon", from: "Alice"}
        ];
        The question now is: which data structure you’d suggest to store the information: “when the message was read?”.

        In the previous task we only needed to store the “yes/no” fact. Now we need to store the date and it,
        once again, should disappear if the message is gone.

    let messages = [
        { text: "Hello", from: "John" },
        { text: "How goes?", from: "John" },
        { text: "See you soon", from: "Alice" }
    ];

    let readMessages = new WeakSet();

    // two messages have been read
    readMessages.add(messages[0]);
    readMessages.add(messages[1]);
    // readMessages has 2 elements

    // ...let's read the first message again!
    readMessages.add(messages[0]);
    // readMessages still has 2 unique elements

    // answer: was the message[0] read?
    alert("Read message 0: " + readMessages.has(messages[0])); // true

    messages.shift();
//
