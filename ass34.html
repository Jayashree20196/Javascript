        Question: Create a function truncate(str, maxlength) that checks the length of the str and,
        if it exceeds maxlength – replaces the end of str with the ellipsis character "…",
        to make its length equal to maxlength.

        The result of the function should be the truncated (if needed) string.

        For instance:

        truncate("What I'd like to tell on this topic is:", 20) = "What I'd like to te…"

        truncate("Hi everyone!", 20) = "Hi everyone!"

    */

    function truncate(str, maxlength) {
        //checks for the length with length
        if (str.length > maxlength) {
            //cuts the length and adds ... to it
            return str.slice(0, maxlength - 1) + '…';
        } else {
            return str;
        }

    }

    alert(truncate("What I'd like to tell on this topic is:", 20))
    alert(truncate("Hi everyone!", 20))
